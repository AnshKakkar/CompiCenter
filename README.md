##Problem Statement

Competitive coding is a major part of today's computer science engineering world. All the company recruitments and skillset judging are based on how people code and to be perfect we need to be practicing our skills by giving various coding exams and competitions and need to be regular at various coding platforms. 
The main problem that arises is not being aware of the various coding events being held currently or getting late to register for the upcoming ones and not able to do proper practice for Interview purpose.


##Solution

What our platform includes:

●	Codeforces Detailed Profile Review

●	Codechef Detailed Profile Review

●	Company wise Question Archive

●	Practice Programs (from Codeforces, Codechef, etc)

●	Upcoming Contest List from Different Plaftorms (like codechef, codeforces, leetcode, hackerearth, atcoder)

●	Compiler to run codes (supported languages : C, C++, Java, Python )

●	Chrome Extension for Upcoming Contest Updates

●	 Decode

●	Login / Signup Page

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

# npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

# npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

# npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
